# uniBackend

This is a project for future references. Please note that config files have been included in the repository on purpose out of convenience.

To run this project, move into the project's root directory using your console and enter ```npm install```, followed by ```npm start```.
In case you are interested in the implemented tests, feel free to run npm test. The tests have been implemented in a way, that they are supposed to **run independentely**. That means that unskipping tests won't be enough to make them run smoothly. This is an issue that will be fixed in the future. Also please take note, that the tests haven't been fully implemented yet and therefore are **still in work**.
